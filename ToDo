CMI Python Stark effect calculations
====================================
- provide option to use sparse matrices (i.e., using scipy.sparse and scipy.sparse.linalg)
- simplify cmistark-calculate-energy by creating the whole spagetthi code to
  define and test for molecule-name from ons single map (parametername ->
  function with definition)
- change scripts to use argparse and to include more help texts (is this done?)
- provide (standalone) tool for merging (HDF5) Stark files
  (does starkeffect_merge work for our purposes?)
- parallelize better by calculating individual Ms/fields separately and merging
  them afterwards (currenlty only parallelization in LAPACK/BLAS is exploited)
- Create "interactive use" module, which can be imported for easy manipulation
  and plotting in an interpreter (e.g., ipython), this could include
  - direct access to figure and easy access functions to HDF5 file
  - allow recalculating Stark curves and updating the HDF5 file
  - plotting, selecting, removing individual curves or groups of curves from
    plot
  - graphical selection of one or a few curves, which will then show the
    assignments/labels for the selected states
    - simply displaying the label of one mouse-selected state would be a plus
      already
