JK Python Stark effect calculations
===================================

- provide (standalone) tool for merging files
- use sparse matrices (i.e., using pysparse)
- parallelize by calculating individual Ms/fields separately and merging them afterwards
- change scripts to use argparse and autmatically make sure that arguments are evaluated in the
  right order
  - i.e., for the molecules make sure that you only store the name and evaluate (in a separate
    function per molecule) it after all arguments are parsed
