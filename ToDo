JK Python Stark effect calculations
===================================
- provide option to use sparse matrices (i.e., using scipy.sparse and scipy.sparse.linalg)
- change scripts to use argparse and to include more help texts
- provide (standalone) tool for merging (HDF5) Stark files
- parallelize better by calculating individual Ms/fields separately and merging
  them afterwards (currenlty only parallelization in LAPACK/BLAS is exploited)
