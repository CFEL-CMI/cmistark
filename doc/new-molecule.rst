Add a new molecule to CMIstark
================================

Firstly, in the file called ``moleculeparameter.py`` (in the ``cmistark`` folder),
add all relevant molecular constants/parameters as a function. See the examples
provided in this file.

Next, in the script file ``cmistark_calculate_energy`` (in the ``script`` folder),
add an option for calling the above added function for the mew molecule. See the
examples provided in this file.
